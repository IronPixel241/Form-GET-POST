# SimpleForm

SimpleForm is a basic web application that demonstrates the usage of HTML forms with both GET and POST methods. It allows users to input data through a form and submit it to the server using either GET or POST requests.

## Features

- **GET Method:** Users can input data through a form, and the data is appended to the URL as query parameters when submitted using the GET method.
- **POST Method:** Alternatively, users can submit the form using the POST method, which sends the form data in the request body rather than as part of the URL.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used for creating the form elements and structure of the web page.
- **Node.js:** Employed as the backend runtime environment for handling server-side logic.
- **Express.js:** Used to define routes and handle HTTP requests, including GET and POST requests.

## Getting Started

To get started with SimpleForm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `node app.js` or `npm start`.

## Usage
